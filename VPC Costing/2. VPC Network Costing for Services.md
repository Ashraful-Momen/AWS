You're asking great questions! Let me clarify the networking costs and access patterns:

## Cost Breakdown

**‚úÖ FREE connections:**
- Public subnet ‚Üí Internet (via Internet Gateway)
- Public subnet ‚Üî Private subnet (same VPC)
- Private subnet ‚Üî Private subnet (same VPC)

**üí∞ PAID connections:**
- Private subnet ‚Üí Internet (requires NAT Gateway ~$32/month)

## Accessing Private Subnet Services

### ‚úÖ **YES - You CAN access private subnet from public subnet for FREE!**

```
Internet ‚Üí Public Subnet (React) ‚Üí Private Subnet (Laravel/MySQL)
                FREE ‚Üê‚Üí FREE
```

**Example setup:**
```
Public Subnet:    React container (accessible from internet)
Private Subnet:   Laravel API, MySQL, Redis, RabbitMQ
```

React can call Laravel API for FREE because they're in the same VPC!

### ‚ùå **You CANNOT use public subnet IPs to access private services directly**

Private subnet services don't get public IPs - that's the point of being "private"!

## How to Make Everything FREE

### **Architecture 1: All Public Subnets** (Cheapest but less secure)
```
Public Subnet: React + Laravel + MySQL + Redis
Cost: $0 for networking
Risk: All services exposed to internet
```

### **Architecture 2: Hybrid** (Recommended balance)
```
Public Subnet:  React (needs internet access)
Private Subnet: Laravel + MySQL + Redis + RabbitMQ
Cost: $0 for internal communication
Cost: $32/month IF Laravel needs external APIs
```

### **Architecture 3: Private with Load Balancer** (Most secure)
```
Public Subnet:  Application Load Balancer only
Private Subnet: React + Laravel + MySQL + Redis
Cost: $16/month for ALB + $32/month for NAT (if needed)
```

## FREE Communication Examples

**‚úÖ These work without any gateways:**
- React (public) calls Laravel API (private): **FREE**
- Laravel (private) connects to MySQL (private): **FREE**  
- Laravel (private) connects to Redis (private): **FREE**

**üí∞ Only costs money:**
- Laravel calling external payment API: **Needs NAT Gateway**
- Downloading packages/updates in private subnet: **Needs NAT Gateway**

## How to Access Private Services

**From public subnet containers:**
```bash
# React container can call Laravel directly using private IP
curl http://10.0.1.100:8000/api/users  # Laravel private IP
```

**From internet (through public containers):**
```
Internet ‚Üí React (public) ‚Üí Laravel API (private) ‚Üí MySQL (private)
```
