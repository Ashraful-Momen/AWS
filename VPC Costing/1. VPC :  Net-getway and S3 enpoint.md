Looking at the VPC endpoints section, the **"S3 Gateway"** option is what allows you to connect to S3.

Here's how it works:

## S3 Gateway Endpoint
- **What it does:** Creates a private connection to Amazon S3 from your VPC
- **Cost:** **Free** (no charges for S3 gateway endpoints)
- **Access:** Allows resources in your private subnets to access S3 buckets without going through the internet
- **Security:** Traffic stays within AWS network

## Why choose S3 Gateway for S3 access:

**Instead of using NAT Gateway for S3:**
- NAT Gateway costs money (~$32/month + data processing fees)
- S3 Gateway is completely free
- Better security (private AWS network only)
- Better performance (no internet routing)

**Recommendation:**
- Select **"S3 Gateway"** in the VPC endpoints section
- This will allow all your private subnet resources to access any S3 bucket
- You can still add NAT gateways if you need general internet access for other services

So to directly answer your question: The **S3 Gateway** option in the VPC endpoints section is specifically designed to connect to S3, and it's the most cost-effective way to do it since it's free compared to routing S3 traffic through expensive NAT gateways.
